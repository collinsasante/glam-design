## Setup Overview

**What you'll create:**
- A "Design URL" field to paste the customer's design
- A "Review Link" field that auto-generates the unique URL
- A "Send Review Link" button that triggers WhatsApp
- An automation that opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message

**How it works:**
1. You upload customer's design to Cloudinary
2. Paste design URL in Airtable
3. Click "Send Review Link" button
4. WhatsApp opens with pre-filled message containing the review link
5. Send to customer

## Step 1: Add Fields to Submissions Table

### 1.1 Add "Design URL" Field
1. Go to your **Submissions** table in Airtable
2. Click **+** to add a new field
3. Choose field type: **URL**
4. Name it: **Design URL**
5. Click **Create field**

### 1.2 Add "Review Link" Field (Formula)
1. Click **+** to add a new field
2. Choose field type: **Formula**
3. Name it: **Review Link**
4. Paste this formula:

```javascript
IF(
  {Design URL},
  CONCATENATE(
    "https://glam-design.pages.dev/Design%20Review.html?project=ORDER-",
    RECORD_ID(),
    "&customer=",
    ENCODE_URL_COMPONENT({Customer Name}),
    "&design=",
    ENCODE_URL_COMPONENT({Design URL})
  ),
  ""
)
```

5. Click **Create field**

**What this does:**
- Generates a unique link for each order
- Uses Airtable's RECORD_ID() as the order number (guaranteed unique)
- URL-encodes customer name and design URL
- Only creates link if Design URL is filled

### 1.3 Add "Send Review Link" Button
1. Click **+** to add a new field
2. Choose field type: **Button**
3. Name it: **Send Review Link**
4. Click **Customize button**
5. Choose action: **Open URL**
6. Paste this formula:

```javascript
CONCATENATE(
  "https://wa.me/",
  SUBSTITUTE({Phone Number}, " ", ""),
  "?text=",
  ENCODE_URL_COMPONENT(
    CONCATENATE(
      "Hi ", {Customer Name}, "! üëã\n\n",
      "Your design for *", {Product Name}, "* is ready for review! üé®\n\n",
      "Please click the link below to view and provide feedback:\n",
      {Review Link}, "\n\n",
      "üìù *How to use:*\n",
      "1. Click anywhere on the design to add comments\n",
      "2. Enter your name and feedback\n",
      "3. Submit\n\n",
      "We look forward to your feedback!\n\n",
      "- Packaging Glamour Team"
    )
  )
)
```

7. Label: **üì± Send via WhatsApp**
8. Click **Save**

## Step 2: Update Your Site URL

### 2.1 If using custom domain:
Replace `https://glam-design.pages.dev` with your actual domain in the formulas above.

Example:
```javascript
"https://forms.yourdomain.com/Design%20Review.html?project=ORDER-",
```

### 2.2 Note about RECORD_ID():
- RECORD_ID() generates unique IDs like `recABC123`
- If you prefer sequential numbers (1, 2, 3), use an **Autonumber** field instead
- To use Autonumber:
  1. Create new field type: **Autonumber**
  2. Name it: **Order Number**
  3. Replace `RECORD_ID()` with `{Order Number}` in the formulas

---

## Step 3: Set Up Automation (Optional - Advanced)

If you want to send automatically instead of clicking button:

### 3.1 Create Automation
1. Go to **Automations** tab in Airtable
2. Click **Create automation**
3. Name it: **Send Design Review Link**

### 3.2 Configure Trigger
1. Choose trigger: **When record matches conditions**
2. Table: **Submissions**
3. Condition: **Design URL** ‚Üí **is not empty**
4. Click **Continue**

### 3.3 Add Action (Optional - requires Zapier or Make.com)
**Note:** Airtable doesn't send WhatsApp messages directly. You have two options:

**Option A: Manual (Recommended)**
- Use the button field (Step 1.3) - it's simpler and free

**Option B: Automatic (Advanced)**
- Requires Zapier or Make.com integration
- Costs money for automation
- Steps:
  1. Airtable ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Zapier/Make
  2. Zapier/Make ‚Üí WhatsApp Business API
  3. Send message with review link

**For most users, the button method is best!**
